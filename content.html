<p>In programming, division can be performed on both integers and floating-point numbers. However, depending on which language and operators are used, one of two types of division may occur: integer division or floating-point division. Both types of division have their own use cases and behaviors and it is important to understand what type of division is being performed in a given context to understand both the numerical value which will be calculated and whether an integer or a float will be returned.</p>

<h2>Floating Point Division</h2>

<p>Floating point division is an operation where the result is a floating-point number. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dividing the float 7.5 by the float 1.5 gives the float 5.0</li>
<li>Dividing the float -6.5 by the integer 2 gives the float -3.25</li>
<li>Dividing the integer 7 by the float -2.0 gives the float -3.5</li>
<li>Dividing the integer 9 by the integer 4 gives the float 2.25</li>
</ul>

<h2>Floor Division</h2>

<p>Floor division is an operation where the result is rounded down to the nearest integer (toward minus infinity). Depending on the data types of the inputs and the language used, the final answer may be either an integer or a float. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dividing the integer 4 by the integer 2 gives the value 2</li>
<li>Dividing the float 9.5 by the integer 4 gives the value 2</li>
<li>Dividing the integer -7 by the float 3.1 gives the value -3</li>
<li>Dividing the float 5 by the float -2.4 gives the value -3</li>
</ul>

<h2>Division by Zero</h2>

<p>Division by zero is undefined in mathematics. Different programming languages handle this in different ways, often resulting in errors or exceptions when an attempt is made to divide by zero.</p>
