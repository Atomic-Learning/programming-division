<p>In programming, division can be performed on both integers and floating-point numbers. However, depending on which data types or operators are used, one of two types of division may occur: integer division or floating-point division. Both types of division have their own use cases and behaviors and it is important to understand what type of division is being performed in a given context to understand both the numerical value which will be calculated and whether an integer or a float will be returned.</p>

<h2>Floating Point Division</h2>

<p>Floating point division is an operation where the result is a floating-point number. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dividing the float 7.5 by the float 1.5 gives the float 5.0</li>
<li>Dividing the float -6.5 by the integer 2 gives the float -3.25</li>
<li>Dividing the integer 7 by the float -2.0 gives the float -3.5</li>
<li>Dividing the integer 9 by the integer 4 gives the float 2.25</li>
</ul>

The result is precise and includes any decimal places.

<h2>Integer Division</h2>

<p>Integer division, on the other hand, is an operation where both the numbers are integers, and the result is also an integer. In this case, any fractional part of the result is discarded (truncated). For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dividing the integer 4 by the integer 2 gives the integer 2</li>
<li>Dividing the integer 9 by the integer 4 gives the integer 2</li>
<li>Dividing the integer -7 by the integer 3 gives the integer -2</li>
<li>Dividing the integer 5 by the integer -2 gives the integer -2</li>
</ul>

<p>In effect, the exact result of the division is rounded toward zero.</p>
